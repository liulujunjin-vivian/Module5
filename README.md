  > store the info in a list and make a dataFrame based on it for a pie chart

  > use python if statements to check if members has enough money in the fund
```python
if total_portfolio > emergency_fund_value:
    print("Congratulations, members has enough money in this fund")
elif total_portfolio == emergency_fund_value:
    print("Congratulations, members reaches this important finacial goal")
else:
    print(f"You have ${total_portfolio - emergency_fund_value} missed.")
```

## Conclusion
#### Question: Will weighting the portfolio more heavily to stocks allow the credit union members to retire after only 10 years?
  > Through the data of decreasing retire year from 30 to 10
  and with higher risk of weight stock more than bond
  We found that although the 95% ci upper remains the same, which is 6.86 of ten years vs 22.09 of thirty years
  however, the CI lower risk increases rapidly, which from 1.044 of 30 years to 0.64 of ten years
  Weighting the portfolio more heavily to stocks seems not allow the credit union members to retire after 10 years
  
  please note the simulator use random number, so the 95 ci lower and upper index may varies
